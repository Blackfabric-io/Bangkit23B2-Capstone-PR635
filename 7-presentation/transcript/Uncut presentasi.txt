3. Stunting is a nutritional problem that needs special treatment, especially in poor and developing countries. Literally, stunting is a condition of failure to grow in children under five caused by chronic nutritional deficiencies and the inability to meet the child's nutritional standards.​

Based on research data from the Ministry of Health, before the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, around 6.3 million toddlers out of Indonesia's total toddler population of 23 million experienced stunting. In fact, the prevalence of stunted toddlers in Indonesia in 2019 reached 27.7%. This puts Indonesia in fourth place globally as the country with the highest cases of stunting.​


4. If left unchecked for a long time, Indonesia will indirectly ignore human rights in terms of the welfare of its people.​

Stunting will have an impact on the country's economic progress due to inadequate human resources.​

Indonesia has the potential to get a bad reputation in the international world, which is correlated with stunting cases which are still high.​


5. Of course, all parties involved want to create new breakthroughs to reduce the frequency of stunting in Indonesia. Various efforts have been made to achieve this. In our group, we take the initiative to differentiate through certain features:​

Food scanning feature that shows the nutritional levels contained​

Article features as a form of education for parents​

Consultation feature with nutrition experts to obtain constructive recommendations​

Our group feels that these three points are still rarely found in other product prototypes. The hope is that the features described above will maximize the real reduction in stunting in Indonesia.​


10. Provides food photo-taking services using cell phone cameras;  ​

Automatically identify types of food and provide an overview of their nutritional composition, making it easier for users to make wise decisions regarding their child's growth and development.​
